chunks) for Indian folk songs classification. Folk
songs from following five regions of India are used
in this research.

  <li>Kashmiri from Kashmir</li>
  <li>Kannada from Karnataka</li>
  <li>Marathi from Maharashtra</li>
</ol> 

Objective of this repository is to provide an
opportunity to researchers to utilize this dataset
and test their algorithms on it. This database can
be used to perform (a) folk songs classification (b)
musical instrument classification (c) language
classification. Except for the first case, classes have
to be manually labeled.
